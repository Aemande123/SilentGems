Silent's Gems - Changelog

2.1.1
Fixed: Server disconnect with saturation (orange) chaos node packets.
Fixed: Phantom Lights being placed inside multi-block tanks and breaking them in some cases. This should also prevent problems with most multi-block structures.

2.1.0
Added: Bows display draw delay (basically the fire rate).
Added: Times thrown statistic for tomahawks.
Added: Tomahawks spawn particles after hitting something. Should make finding them a bit easier since they still seem to render in the wrong place sometimes.
Removed: Beta greetings.
Changed: Thrown tomahawks will despawn after 10 minutes now.
Changed: Improved tomahawk block collision detection a bit.

2.0.33
Fixed: Enchantment token recipes getting mixed up when new enchantments are added to an existing world. All existing tokens with enchantments will no longer work, but can be crafted back into the blank tokens.

2.0.32
Added: Concentration enchantment, which boosts magic damage. Cannot be applied with other damage-boosting enchantments (Sharpness, etc.)
Added: Life Steal enchantment is back. Restores your health a bit when you deal damage. Token recipe is different.
Added: A colored outline for enchantment tokens. Should make finding the one you want a bit easier.
Removed: Old, unused bow textures.
Changed: Small buff to magic damage.
Changed: Shield colors are now properly cached, which should improve FPS some.
Fixed: Enchantment tokens allowing conflicting enchantments to be applied.

2.0.31
Road to Release! I will be focused on fixing/polishing things instead of new features.
Added: Configs for tomahawk ammo (maximum and the amount restored when decorating).
Added: A Chaos bar to the Material Grader and Chaos Altar GUIs.
Added: You can now get headshots with tomahawks, which deal double damage.
Added: Particles (damage dealt and crit) for tomahawks.
Added: A magic cooldown. Mostly to prevent accidental spam when looking at a block.
Added: Config to change the variety bonus for mixed-material tools.
Changed: Default tomahawk max ammo to 4.
Changed: Default tomahawk ammo per material when decorating to 1.
Fixed: Some desync with the Material Grader causing it to display incorrect values. Hopefully. Let me know if issues persist.
Fixed: Materials that restore no durability when decorating will no longer restore ammo.

2.0.30
Added: Tomahawks! They can be used as a melee weapon or thrown. Throwing them deals much more damage. Thrown tomahawks can be retrieved by walking over them. Lost tomahawks ("ammo") can be replaced by decorating. They can also chop wood, but not very well.
Added: Recipes for enchantment tokens with some mod enchantments (Ender Core/IO/Zoo)
Changed: Enchantment Tokens are now sorted (first by type, then by enchantment name)
Changed: Default Ender Essence ore frequency significantly reduced.
Fixed: Bows are animated now. Shouldn't have any major performance impact.
Fixed: Broken bows being destroyed and some other bow bugs.
Fixed: Gem lamps not responding to redstone (guess that broke in 1.10?)

2.0.29
Added: Bows! Still a work in progress, but should be craftable and usable. Animation does not work and some parts do not render properly.
Removed: Some debug text being output to console.

2.0.28
Actually fixed my Guide-API issues >_<
Tweaked shield damage reflection, add minimum blocking power.

Fixed: Fluffy puffs being rejected by Random Things' fertilized dirt.
'b' build:
Fixed: A Guide-API crash.
Fixed: Shields in JEI showing incorrect recipes.
'c' build:
Added: Guide-API error handling. No more crashing, but you won't get a guide book if an error occurs. I'm currently looking for fixes to these issues.

2.0.26
Added: Shield models! They render like normal items, so might not be what you would expect... I think they look alright, but textures need a little touching-up.
Fixed: Shields trying to load a bunch of non-existent models and scrambling tool textures.
Fixed: A crash when planting fluffy puff seeds.

2.0.25
Added: An early version of shields! Modular, functional, and craftable... but no models yet. Enjoy the big red X.

2.0.20
Added: Chaos Node levitation packets (green). Targets hostile mobs, making baddies fly away!
Added: Chaos Node saturation packets (orange). Restores a bit of hunger, but they are uncommon.
Added: Configs for mobs spawning with gem swords and coffee drops (wait, this mod adds coffee?)
Added: Some debug info for the Return Home Charm, might help solve the 'Destination Obstructed' bug.
Fixed: A potential (and very bad) issue with profiling (massive FPS drops, I'm so sorry!)
Fixed (maybe): Some issues with teleporting, such as creation of Nether portals.

2.0.19
Ported to 1.10 (a single import change... seriously?)

2.0.18
Added: Chaos Node regen packets.
Added: Headcrumbs mobs can now spawn with gem swords, and do so more often than zombies.

Added: Zombies and Skeletons have a chance to spawn with custom gem swords/katanas.
Fixed: Flint tools having the wrong color.
Fixed: Potential crash/error with MessageItemRename packets.

2.0.16
Fixed armor protection! Up to 20 armor points (10 pieces, a full bar), armor should be identical to vanilla. Past that, each point adds 1% additional damage absorption.
Added: Bonus armor bar. Armor values past 20 points will render gold armor pieces on top of the normal armor bar.
Added: Standard armor types to subitems and recipes for JEI.
Added: Temporary armor item textures, complete with color! Temporary armor models are still just white...

Lots more work on armor, lots more to be done.
Added: Armor detailed tooltips.
Added: Secrets.
Changed: Default keybinding for 'Toggle Special' is now Shift + C.

Added: Sag Mill recipes (Ender IO) for ores
Fixed: Material grades not being applied to all tools (notably single-material pickaxes).
Added more foundation for modular armor (no, nothing works yet). Tool main parts will now display a "Protection" stat. As for what the numbers mean... I'm not entirely sure. They may change, so assume nothing!

2.0.12
Ported to 1.9.4.

2.0.11
Note: The tool system has had some tweaking done! Tools in your inventory when you log in will be updated automatically. Others can be fixed by placing them in a crafting grid.
Added: Tier tooltips for tool materials and rod. Rods display a list of compatible tiers, not the rod's actual tier.
Added: Loot table stuff.

(API) Added: A way to set the color of individual parts.
(API) Added: A way to set part display names and prefixes. These are used in tool name generation.

Mark as Beta.
Updated for Guide-API 2.0.0-31.
Changed: Some greetings.
Fixed: Return Home Charm not working well across dimensions (false positive on obstruction check)

2.0.9
Added: Chaos Flower Pot. You can plant glow roses in it, which will emit more light than normal and place "phantom lights" up to 15 blocks away.
Added: Gem Lamps are back.
Added: Drawing Compass. It draws circles and lines with particles. Click two blocks, sneak + click to clear.
Added: A function for the magnifying glass. Usefulness is questionable.
Changed: Teleporters can now draw Chaos from the player and the player's inventory, if necessary.
Fixed: Many items being usable as furnace fuel that shouldn't be.
Fixed: Chaos Altar not rendering in world. (M4thG33k)
Fixed: Katanas in JEI/creative tab missing default grip.
Fixed (maybe, probably not): A rare random crash in PlayerDataHandler.

2.0.8
Added: A guide book. Finally. Requires Guide-API to be installed (optional, but you won't get the guide without it).
Changed: Glow Rose textures. I think they're OK, but let me know if I'm wrong.

2.0.7
Added: Chaos Altar is back. Leave items that store chaos in an altar to recharge them! (Yes, I know it's invisible)
Changed: Pylons now send Chaos to blocks using packets, like nodes.
Changed: Pylons and nodes will evenly split Chaos among all available targets.
Fixed: Chaos Pylon renderers (M4thG33k)

2.0.6
Added: Return Home Charm is back. It run on Chaos now, like teleporters.
Added: Chaos Essence/Coal blocks.
Added: Pet summoners are back.
Changed: Toned down Chaos Node particles a bit (fewer, slower, and bigger). They still respect particle settings.
Fixed: Chaos Coal not being usable as fuel.
Fixed: Teleporter Linker missing model when active.
Fixed: Teleporter Linker HUD graphical glitches.
Fixed: Spent Node Mover being usable without repairing.
Fixed: Material Grader missing texture.
Fixed: Server crash with Material Grader.

2.0.5
Added: Teleporters are back! They run on Chaos now, rather than XP. The math is about the same: it charges for horizontal travel only and short trips are free.
Added: Chaos Node Mover. Reusable, but must be repaired with nether shards after use.
Changed: Broken tools can no longer place blocks.
Fixed: Shovels not being able to make grass paths.

2.0.4
Added: Enchantment Tokens! Everyone's(?) favorite feature is back. Recipes have changed slightly, please check JEI. Mechanics have also changed:
  1. Enchantment Tokens for ALL enchantments should be generated, although only vanilla ones (not other mods) have recipes.
  2. Tokens can be applied to anything the enchantment would normally work on. Tokens on Elytra, anyone?
  3. Enchantment tokens can carry multiple enchantments (currently not possible without cheating)
  4. Enchantment tokens can have enchantments with levels greater than 1 now (currently not possible without cheating)
Added: Supercharged gem blocks. Supposed to be wither-proof, but I haven't solved that problem yet. Highly blast-resistant, but cannot be uncrafted! Made with 1 obsidian and 4 supercharged gems.
Added: Gem bricks. As before, they have 'coated' and 'speckled' versions, as well as light/dark versions like all gem blocks. That's a total of 64 bricks to choose from.
Added: Chaos node 'packets'. Little balls of goodness that nodes spew out:
  1. Attack packets will seek and damage hostile mobs.
  2. Repair packets will seek players and repair a damaged item slightly.
  3. Chaos packets are roughly the same as before. They recharge Chaos.
Fixed: Chaos packets being sent to players who are full.
Fixed: Chaos node packets not rendering on servers.
Fixed: Chaos nodes not sending chaos to blocks.
Fixed: Tools missing the "-Tipped" line in their tooltips.
Fixed: Tipped upgrades missing their tooltips

2.0.3
Updated for Forge 1833. Update Silent Lib to 1.0.3!
Added: The Material Grader. Insert main tool parts (ie gems, flint, etc) to assign a random grade. Requires Chaos to function, so place it near nodes/pylons. Grades boost tool stats. Grades are normally distributed, with a mean of 'B' and a standard deviation of 1.5 grades (assuming I got the math right). And yes, I know one of its textures is missing.
Added: Tooltips for tool rods.
Added: Tooltips for the grade on grade-able materials (gems, etc).
Changed: Improved Gem tooltips.
Fixed: Gems not being registered in the ore dictionary.

2.0.2
Added: Name Plates. Basically just like the one from Pets. Name it on an anvil, then craft with an item to rename. Or you can use it like a name tag.
Added: Broken tools! Unlike before, they don't transform into a new item. Decorate broken tools to repair them. And yes, I know applying a tip upgrade can repair broken tools as well. That's OK. I think.
Added: Recipes for chaos pylons.
Added: Ore dictionary support for gem parts. For example, rubies from other mods can be used in multi-gem tools.
Changed: Chaos orbs are a bit more forgiving. They will crack twice before shattering.
Changed: Chaos node generation rate and send amount doubled.
Fixed: Tool decorating/repairing not working.
Fixed: Tool recipes picking up extra materials...
Fixed: Tools on the ground being gigantic.
Fixed: Burner pylons not working.

2.0.1
Added: Context-sensitive bar that displays the player's chaos (replaces the text)
Added: Area Miner skill for pickaxes and shovels. Works like the enchantment in previous versions. Press 'Toggle Special' (C key by default) to turn it on or off. Super-tier tools only, requires a small amount of chaos to function. Works in creative mode.
Added: Lumberjack skill for axes. Same mechanics as Area Miner. Does NOT work in creative mode (it could, but I think that's a bad idea...)
Added: Crosshairs are replaced with slightly different ones when Area Miner or Lumberjack is activated.
Added: Partially functional (but not craftable) chaos pylons.
Removed: The enchanted effect from all tools until a fix is found (if that's even possible).
Changed: Gem ore textures (gem bits are smaller, dark ores are darker)
Fixed: Dark gem ores dropping the wrong gems.
Fixed: Non-supercharged swords draining chaos.
Fixed: Axes losing durability on leaves.
Fixed: Alpha greetings not showing on servers.
Fixed: Crash with improper materials in decorating recipe.
Fixed (maybe): Chaos transfer not colliding with target player sometimes.
