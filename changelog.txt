Silent's Gems - Changelog

2.0.7
Added: Chaos Altar is back. Leave items that store chaos in an altar to recharge them! (Yes, I know it's invisible)
Changed: Pylons now send Chaos to blocks using packets, like nodes.
Changed: Pylons and nodes will evenly split Chaos among all available targets.
Fixed: Chaos Pylon renderers (M4thG33k)

2.0.6
Added: Return Home Charm is back. It run on Chaos now, like teleporters.
Added: Chaos Essence/Coal blocks.
Added: Pet summoners are back.
Changed: Toned down Chaos Node particles a bit (fewer, slower, and bigger). They still respect particle settings.
Fixed: Chaos Coal not being usable as fuel.
Fixed: Teleporter Linker missing model when active.
Fixed: Teleporter Linker HUD graphical glitches.
Fixed: Spent Node Mover being usable without repairing.
Fixed: Material Grader missing texture.
Fixed: Server crash with Material Grader.

2.0.5
Added: Teleporters are back! They run on Chaos now, rather than XP. The math is about the same: it charges for horizontal travel only and short trips are free.
Added: Chaos Node Mover. Reusable, but must be repaired with nether shards after use.
Changed: Broken tools can no longer place blocks.
Fixed: Shovels not being able to make grass paths.

2.0.4
Added: Enchantment Tokens! Everyone's(?) favorite feature is back. Recipes have changed slightly, please check JEI. Mechanics have also changed:
  1. Enchantment Tokens for ALL enchantments should be generated, although only vanilla ones (not other mods) have recipes.
  2. Tokens can be applied to anything the enchantment would normally work on. Tokens on Elytra, anyone?
  3. Enchantment tokens can carry multiple enchantments (currently not possible without cheating)
  4. Enchantment tokens can have enchantments with levels greater than 1 now (currently not possible without cheating)
Added: Supercharged gem blocks. Supposed to be wither-proof, but I haven't solved that problem yet. Highly blast-resistant, but cannot be uncrafted! Made with 1 obsidian and 4 supercharged gems.
Added: Gem bricks. As before, they have 'coated' and 'speckled' versions, as well as light/dark versions like all gem blocks. That's a total of 64 bricks to choose from.
Added: Chaos node 'packets'. Little balls of goodness that nodes spew out:
  1. Attack packets will seek and damage hostile mobs.
  2. Repair packets will seek players and repair a damaged item slightly.
  3. Chaos packets are roughly the same as before. They recharge Chaos.
Fixed: Chaos packets being sent to players who are full.
Fixed: Chaos node packets not rendering on servers.
Fixed: Chaos nodes not sending chaos to blocks.
Fixed: Tools missing the "-Tipped" line in their tooltips.
Fixed: Tipped upgrades missing their tooltips

2.0.3
Updated for Forge 1833. Update Silent Lib to 1.0.3!
Added: The Material Grader. Insert main tool parts (ie gems, flint, etc) to assign a random grade. Requires Chaos to function, so place it near nodes/pylons. Grades boost tool stats. Grades are normally distributed, with a mean of 'B' and a standard deviation of 1.5 grades (assuming I got the math right). And yes, I know one of its textures is missing.
Added: Tooltips for tool rods.
Added: Tooltips for the grade on grade-able materials (gems, etc).
Changed: Improved Gem tooltips.
Fixed: Gems not being registered in the ore dictionary.

2.0.2
Added: Name Plates. Basically just like the one from Pets. Name it on an anvil, then craft with an item to rename. Or you can use it like a name tag.
Added: Broken tools! Unlike before, they don't transform into a new item. Decorate broken tools to repair them. And yes, I know applying a tip upgrade can repair broken tools as well. That's OK. I think.
Added: Recipes for chaos pylons.
Added: Ore dictionary support for gem parts. For example, rubies from other mods can be used in multi-gem tools.
Changed: Chaos orbs are a bit more forgiving. They will crack twice before shattering.
Changed: Chaos node generation rate and send amount doubled.
Fixed: Tool decorating/repairing not working.
Fixed: Tool recipes picking up extra materials...
Fixed: Tools on the ground being gigantic.
Fixed: Burner pylons not working.

2.0.1
Added: Context-sensitive bar that displays the player's chaos (replaces the text)
Added: Area Miner skill for pickaxes and shovels. Works like the enchantment in previous versions. Press 'Toggle Special' (C key by default) to turn it on or off. Super-tier tools only, requires a small amount of chaos to function. Works in creative mode.
Added: Lumberjack skill for axes. Same mechanics as Area Miner. Does NOT work in creative mode (it could, but I think that's a bad idea...)
Added: Crosshairs are replaced with slightly different ones when Area Miner or Lumberjack is activated.
Added: Partially functional (but not craftable) chaos pylons.
Removed: The enchanted effect from all tools until a fix is found (if that's even possible).
Changed: Gem ore textures (gem bits are smaller, dark ores are darker)
Fixed: Dark gem ores dropping the wrong gems.
Fixed: Non-supercharged swords draining chaos.
Fixed: Axes losing durability on leaves.
Fixed: Alpha greetings not showing on servers.
Fixed: Crash with improper materials in decorating recipe.
Fixed (maybe): Chaos transfer not colliding with target player sometimes.
