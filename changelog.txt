Fixed: Crash with non-existent crafting materials.

1.3.00-beta03
Added: Chaos Altar and Pylons (passive and burner), part of a new work-in-progress energy-generation system. Just for chaos gems right now.
Added: Return Home gem variants (cosmetic).
Removed: Some unused config options.
Changed: Chaos gem energy consumption to per tick, instead of per second.
Changed: Chaos gem default max capacity to 1 million (config not respected at this time).
Changed: Flight chaos gem effect will only drain charge when the user is flying (100/t) or falling fast (10/t).

Changed: Return Home takes damage on teleporting. 64 uses.
Changed: Making chaos coal with charcoal is more expensive.

Fixed: Area Miner dig speed being too nerfed.

1.3.00-beta02
Added: Redstone Teleporters. They work just like normal gem teleporters, but can also be activated by a redstone pulse.
Added: Teleporter Anchors. Teleporters can be linked to them, but anchors are not capable of teleporting. Useful for building complex networks of teleports.
Added: Ore dictionary entries for gem blocks.
Added: Recipe to craft Chaos Coal Blocks from Chaos Essence Blocks and Coal Blocks.
Changed: Mending now works on armor.
Changed: Many recipes now use the ore dictionary.
Changed: Internal name of Beryl to Beryl (was Emerald). Config option for the weight of Beryl will change its name as well.
Fixed: Flight Chaos Gems not resetting fall distance
Fixed: Flight Chaos Gems not being activated by hotkeys.

1.3.00-beta01
Added: Gem/Chaos ores and Glow Roses can now be pulverized.
Added: Gem armor. Textures need work, I know.
Added: Armor Enchantment Tokens.
Added: Recipe to craft Enchantment Tokens back into the blank version.
Added: Chaos Coal and Chaos Coal Blocks. Four times the energy of coal (configurable). Crafted with coal and chaos essence.
Added: Configurable weights for gem spawns. This allows certain gems to be made more or less common, instead of being totally random like before.
Changed: Multiple enchantment tokens can be applied at once. Just put one tool/armor item in the crafting grid and put tokens in any free slots.
Changed: Blank Enchantment Tokens now have a meta of 256, instead of 0. This was necessary because Enchantment Token meta values match enchantment IDs. Protection's ID is 0. Enjoy your free protection tokens!
Changed: Enchantment Tokens are ordered by group, instead of meta.
Fixed: Version number not being set.

1.2.07b
Fixed: Sickles for real this time, I think.

Changed: Return Home resets fall distance (no more fall damage when teleporting).
Changed: Return Home checks for obstructions.
Changed: Unbreaking and Mending no longer conflict.
Changed: Sickles rewritten. They now clear a 9x9x1 area, instead of a 3x3x3 cube. Also less laggy.
