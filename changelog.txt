1.3.00-beta02
Added: Redstone Teleporters. They work just like normal gem teleporters, but can also be activated by a redstone pulse.

Changed: Multiple enchantment tokens can be applied at once. Just put one tool/armor item in the crafting grid and put tokens in any free slots.
Changed: Blank Enchantment Tokens now have a meta of 256, instead of 0. This was necessary because Enchantment Token meta values match enchantment IDs. Protection's ID is 0. Enjoy your free protection tokens!
Changed: Enchantment Tokens are ordered by group, instead of meta.
Fixed: Version number not being set.

Fixed: Sickles for real this time, I think.
